Scrum starts from Product Backlog which contains all work to be done or<br>describes\/represents what will fulfills the Product Goal and it is maintained by Product<br>Owner. He\/ She also make sure that top items are important one.<br>2. Then we have planning meeting in which developers select an item from Product<br>Backlog (Sprint Backlog created).<br>3. Sprint Backlog promotes expectational alignment between business and technical<br>team.<br>4. During the execution of sprint developers run Daily Scrum to synchronize their work<br>and maximize chances of achieving product goal.<br>5. During the sprint the moment Product Backlog items meet the Definition of Done<br>(DOD) an Increment is born.<br>6. At the end of sprint team run review meeting in which Product Owner invites the<br>stakeholders to inspect the produced increment. During this event feedback from<br>stakeholders might impact Product Backlog.<br>7. After Review meeting scrum team participate in Retrospective meeting in which they<br>inspect and adapts how the work has been done and plan for continue improvement.<br>8. Scrum Master is responsible to run whole scrum process smoothly.<br>Scrum as a Value Driven Effort:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-1024x497.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57\" width=\"689\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-1024x497.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-300x145.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-768x372.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-1000x485.png 1000w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-230x112.png 230w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-350x170.png 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1-480x233.png 480w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-1.png 1324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Ideas are register in Product Backlog which comes from Product Vision. To deliver<br>better value product backlog must have good value too.<br>2. Product Owner is responsible for maintaining Product Backlog.<br>3. Product Backlog Refinement is ongoing process.<br>4. Increment is the output of the sprint also we called it vertical delivery.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-1024x432.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-59\" width=\"654\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-1024x432.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-300x127.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-768x324.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-1000x422.png 1000w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-230x97.png 230w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-350x148.png 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3-480x203.png 480w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-3.png 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scrum follows Agile methodology of Iterative and Incremental development. A partial<br>implementation of a total system is constructed so that it will be in a deliverable state.<br>Increased functionality is added. Defects, if any, from the prior delivery are fixed and the<br>working product is delivered. The process is repeated until the entire product<br>development is completed. The repetitions of these processes are called iterations. At the<br>end of every iteration, a product increment is delivered.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-1024x431.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-60\" width=\"630\" height=\"265\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-1024x431.png 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-300x126.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-768x323.png 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-1000x421.png 1000w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-230x97.png 230w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-350x147.png 350w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4-480x202.png 480w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/image-4.png 1309w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#40484a\"><strong>Scrum Theory:<\/strong><br>Scrum is founded on following:<br><strong>1. Empiricism:<\/strong> Its mean knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based<br>on what is being observed.<br><strong>2. Lean Thinking:<\/strong> Its mean new way of thinking and focus on essentials (most needed)<br>and reduces wastes. Like if daily scrum event objective completed in 5 minutes, then<br>there is no need to stay in meeting for 15 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Empiricism stands on Three pillars which are following:<br><strong>1. Transparency:<\/strong> It refers to common standard of understanding mean all observers<br>share a common understanding on what is being seen and spoke. The significant<br>aspect of process must be visible to those responsible for outcome. In Scrum<br>transparency is implemented in 4 Scrum events and 3 artifacts.<br><strong>2. Inspection:<\/strong> It is a testing hypothesis for checking what is happened also learning and<br>adapting from it. Scrum set 4 events for inspection.<br><strong>3. Adaptation:<\/strong> During inspection if any process seems deviating from outside limits, then<br>adjustment must be made as early as possible.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find more information in <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1GFLgW4_28MnKaRHPo7Bq_769aECQ7EA9\/view?usp=sharing\">this document<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Scrum teams take a problem and divide into smaller chunks and run incremental anditerative method:For Example:o Listing the features of website [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":83,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/34\/revisions\/83"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
