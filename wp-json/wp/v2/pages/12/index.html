But Agile principles offer more than just a framework for software developers.They encourage a&nbsp;<em>mindset<\/em>&nbsp;that helps project managers in any field focus on continuous learning, change, and collaboration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"423\" height=\"390\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Agile.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Agile.png 423w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Agile-300x277.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Agile-230x212.png 230w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Agile-350x323.png 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Agile Principles<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Satisfy the customer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile philosophy focuses on approaching product design from the perspective of the customer rather than following the \u201cwe know what\u2019s best\u201d model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an Agile team, your #1 priority should always be a satisfied customer. As the saying goes, \u201cthe customer is always right,\u201d even when they aren\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Don\u2019t be afraid of change<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A crucial part of Agile is the ability to harness change and switch direction at any point in time if it helps your customer\u2019s competitive advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the final stretch and there\u2019s suddenly a request for a new feature added, what do you do? Traditional methods would argue that it\u2019s a hard no \u2014 it\u2019s too late in the game to go back to the drawing board. The Agile approach urges you to say yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Deliver working versions frequently<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Agile mindset focuses on \u201cchunking down\u201d projects into smaller, individual portions or sprints, and delivering a functioning version of the end product at the end of each sprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average sprint length is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scrumalliance.org\/learn-about-scrum\/state-of-scrum\/2018-state-of-scrum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2.4 weeks<\/a>, and the average length of an entire Scrum project (type of Agile project) is only 11.6 weeks. This translates to products being delivered much earlier and more frequently than in traditional methodologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Bring business people and \u201ctechies\u201d together<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Agile method promotes collaboration between the client, the customer-facing \u201cbusiness people\u201d (i.e., your sales and marketing teams), and the technical gurus who are actually building the solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the client asks sales for something and then sales sends the request to production and walks away, you\u2019re playing a dangerous game of telephone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having everyone plugged in throughout the whole process ensures the customer doesn\u2019t end up with a rope when they asked for a swing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Motivate, trust, and support your team<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile businesses build projects around motivated teams. Agile leaders know that with the right environment, support, and trust, people will do their best work and produce quality outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bain.com\/contentassets\/caa40128a49c4f34800a76eae15828e3\/bain_brief-management_tools_and_trends.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bain survey<\/a>&nbsp;reported that out of 1,300 global executives, the majority agreed with the statement: \u201cToday\u2019s business leaders must trust and empower people, not command and control them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 5% disagreed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Engage in face-to-face conversation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Agile, frequent face-to-face conversations (video conferencing for virtual teams) are essential between team members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you can see facial expressions and body language there\u2019s less chance for misunderstandings. Plus more information can be conveyed faster than via email or other written methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Measure progress with working versions of the final product<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile is built around delivering progressively more detailed or advanced versions of the product until you hit the final end deliverable that checks all the requirements boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Encourage sustainable development<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Agile team should keep a constant, sustainable pace throughout the project. It\u2019s about setting a pace your team can keep up indefinitely rather than having a 60-hour work week one week and 20 hours the next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan events with the help of Agile boards. By prioritizing tasks and dividing them into stages, they\u2019re able to avoid burning the team out with last minute panic and stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Pay attention to technical excellence and good design<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional PM methods, such as Waterfall, take a sequential approach to projects with testing near the very end. So, if you discover there\u2019s a problem, it could take forever to find the root cause \u2014 And even longer to go back and fix it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile emphasizes continuous testing and monitoring so you can spot and fix issues early. Image scrolling through 100 lines of code every two weeks compared to reviewing 10,000 lines of code for the first time at the end of the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Keep it simple<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an Agile process, simplicity is about three things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Minimizing work that doesn\u2019t add value.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Going with the simplest design and adding on features later.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Looking for ways to do more with less.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Use self-organizing teams<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managers shouldn\u2019t need to micromanage a project team \u2014 They\u2019ve got enough to do and it\u2019s not good for employees. Nearly half (<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/07\/remote-managers-are-having-trust-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">49%<\/a>) of remote workers being micromanaged are dealing with work-related anxiety. Only 7% of those not being micromanaged have the same struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile teams need to be able to make decisions. They need to organize and manage work on their own. These teams are happier, more productive, faster, and more reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12. Regularly reflect and review<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most agile frameworks include a retrospective at the end of each phase or sprint. Retrospectives are about reviewing what went well and what didn\u2019t, and talking about how you can improve going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus on continuous improvement helps your team stay adaptable, and look for ways to improve their processes and work. It\u2019s the mindset that allows you to achieve other principles like finding simpler ways to do things and not being afraid of change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Agile Implementations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile is only a specification and that there are software process models that implement Agile, examples being \u201cExtreme programming\u201d, \u201cScrum\u201d, and \u201cDSDM\u201d. Try to give a brief explanation for each process models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Extreme Programming (XP)<\/strong>. Proposed by Kent Beck, it is the most widely used Agile process. This process utilizes Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) cards as user stories. One of the practices used in XP is pair programming, where two people (developers) work together directly on the same system when developing code, to promote better communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scrum<\/strong>. Conceived by Jeff Sutherland and his team in early 1900s  is a software development framework which every activity occurs in a time-boxed (from two weeks to a month) event called \u201csprint\u201d. Each sprint consists of these activities:\u00a0<strong>sprint planning<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>daily scrum<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>meeting<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>sprint review<\/strong>, and\u00a0<strong>sprint retrospective<\/strong>. Each sprint is done in order to achieve desired\u00a0<strong>sprint goals<\/strong>, with each deliverable is termed as \u201cincrement\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)<\/strong>. This process model is based on an approach that \u201cprovides a framework for building and maintaining systems which meet tight time constraints through the use of incremental prototyping in a controlled project environment\u201d. This process model has a philosophy that says \u201c80 percent of an application can be delivered in 20 percent of the time it would take to deliver the complete (100 percent) application\u201d.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction to Agile Agile is one of the most popular, widely adapted framework that can be used to build software, from small [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":54,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12\/revisions\/54"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
